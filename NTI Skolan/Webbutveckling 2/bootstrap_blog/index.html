      <h2>Sous Vide</h2>

      <p>Sous vide also known as low temperature long time (LTLT) cooking, is a method of cooking in which food is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours, up to 72 or more hours in some cases) at a precisely regulated temperature.
      The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 째C (130 to 140 째F) for red meat, 66 to 71 째C (150 to 160 째F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.</p>

      <h2>Bella Pico 2G - Stand Micxer</h2>
      <h5>Apr 18, 2021</h5>
      <img class="card-img mb-4" src="img/biolomix.jpg" alt="mixer">
      <p>The big little one: The Klarstein Bella Pico 2G kitchen machine delivers new power in a compact class with the usual high-quality, simple operation and space-saving design.
      <br><br>
      Klarstein Bella Pico 2G kitchen machine is the logical further development of its predecessor: With compact dimensions that also find their place on smaller work surfaces in combination with a large mixing bowl with a capacity of 5 liters and an extra strong motor, which powerfully kneads even tough yeast dough with the power 1200 watts. In this way, Bella Pico 2G is also perfect for large amounts of food. The proven planetary agitation system from Klarstein, means that the agitation tools not only spin around but also in orbits in the mixer bowl. The result is that the ingredients are constantly controlled from the edge into the middle of the bowl and an optimal mixture is achieved. 6 speed modes and heart rate function perfectly fit all requirements in modern kitchens - from quick whipping of cream to careful kneading of heavy bread dough.
      <br><br>
      The delivery includes a dough hook and flat mixer made of high-quality cast aluminum and a whisk made of stainless steel. Thus, you always have the right tools: dough hook for tough bread dough, flat mixer for medium-thick cake doughs and whisk for cream or butter. With its compact, well-shaped housing made of ABS plastic, the Klarstein Bella Pico 2G kitchen machine does not need much space, and visually fits very well into the kitchen.
      <br><br>
      Proven quality and more power for the best stirring results with a small space requirement: Bella Pico 2G kitchen machine from Klarstein.
